I am an Indie Python Developer with a focus in CyberSecurity Scripting and Ethical Hacking, currently pursuing a Masters in Cyber and Information Operations from the University of Arizona. All coding problems in my public repositories are built from the ground up with code-along tutorials or entirely by me. My content is published daily on this page along with other fun side projects, like game-dev creations in python and other coding languages. You can follow any updates of mine on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christiantstu/) and feel free to shoot me a message if you feel so inclined! I love speaking with other developers as well as talking through challenging coding problems.
